## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to set up up to 5 main articles
    So that site users can see them on the Home page

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user configures the Main articles section on the Home page</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I am on the <b>Home</b> configuration page
Then I see <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save all changes</b> buttons on the top right corner
  And I see the <b>Main articles</b> section on the top of the page
  And I see the <b>Main articles</b> section contains a form with the following fields:
    - <b>Category</b> contains a list of all sports categories, first category from the list is selected by default, is required
    - <b>Subcategory</b> contains a list of all subcategories, nothing is selected by default
    - <b>Team</b> contains a list of all teams, nothing is selected by default
    - <b>Article</b> contains a list of all articles from the category, is required
    - The <b>Add one more article</b> button
    - The <b>Show on the main page</b> toggle

When I add one more article
Then the <b>Delete</b> button appears for both present articles forms

When I click <b>Delete</b>
Then the confirmation pop-up window appears

When I click <b>Yes</b> in the confirmation pop-up window
Then I see the row is removed from the page
  And the <b>Delete</b> button is not shown for the last article form

When I click the <b>Add one more article</b> button four times
Then the <b>Add one more article</b> button disappears

When I click the <b>Show on the main page</b> toggle on any article form
Then the <b>Show on the main page</b> toggle changes to <b>Hide on the main page</b>

When I change the category in the drop-down list
Then I see the <b>Subcategory</b> drop-down list is updated with subcategories according to the selected category
  And I see the <b>Team</b> drop-down list is updated with teams according to the selected category
  And I see the <b>Article</b> drop-down list is updated with articles according to the selected category

When I select <b>Subcategory</b>
Then I see the <b>Team</b> drop-down list is updated with teams according to the selected subcategory 
  And I see the <b>Article</b> drop-down list is updated with articles according to the selected subcategory

When I select <b>Team</b>
  Then I see the <b>Article</b> drop-down list is updated with articles according to the selected team

When I click the <b>Cancel</b> button
Then I see all changes are canceled

When I click the <b>Save all changes</b> button and there are validation errors
Then I see all changes are present and there are validation errors highlighted

When I click the <b>Save all changes</b> button and there are no validation errors
Then all changes are saved and I see the <b>Publish</b> button

When I click the <b>Publish</b> button
Then the <b>Home</b> page is in the published state
  And I see a success flash message
  And I see <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save all changes</b> buttons on the top right corner
