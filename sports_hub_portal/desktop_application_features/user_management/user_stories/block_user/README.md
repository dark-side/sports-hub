## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to be able to block users
    So that they won’t have access to comments

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user blocks the user</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I am on the <b>Users</b> configuration page
  And I view the <b>Users</b> tab
Then I see the <b>Block</b> button on the right of active users

When I select an active user and then click <b>Block</b>
Then I see the confirmation dialog

When I click <b>Continue</b>
Then I see the confirmation dialog is closed
  And I see a notification message that the user has been OR has not been blocked
  And I see the user’s status is changed to <b>Blocked</b> if the action was successful
  And the blocked user cannot comment
  And notification about blocking is sent to the user’s email
</pre>
