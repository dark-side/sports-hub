## Description

Create a Sports Hub site project layout structure that will be common for any of the pages:
  - Site header section
  - Site footer section
  - Site main navigation section on the left side
  - Main content area section
  - Right sidebar section

Also, there should be a special behavior of the site logo. It should navigate users to the home page. The external links (if any) should open in a new tab. Admin should have the ability to act as a regular user.
Please note, page content sections are configured by admin.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Users should go to the home page by clicking the logo
  - The layout structure should be the same for all pages
  - Third-party site should open in a separate browser tab when the user selects an external link
  - Pages should be built from content sections that are configured by admin
  - Admin should have the ability to act as a regular user and go back to the admin view
