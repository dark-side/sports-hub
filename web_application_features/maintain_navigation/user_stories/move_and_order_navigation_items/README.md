## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to change order of the navigation menu items and move them between the categories and subcategories

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user changes order of the navigation menu categories, subcategories, and teams and moves them between the categories and subcategories</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I am on the <b>Information architecture</b> configuration page
  And I select a category
Then I can drag and drop it up and down to change the order of the categories

When I select a subcategory
Then I can drag and drop it up and down to change the order of the subcategories inside the category
  And I can drag and drop it with all teams inside to any category

When I select the team
Then I can drag and drop it up and down to change the order of the teams inside the subcategory
  And I can drag and drop it to any subcategory of any category

When I hover over a category, subcategory, or team name
Then on the right of each category, subcategory, or team name, I see the ellipsis (<b>...</b>) button

When I click the ellipsis (<b>...</b>) button for any created category
Then I see the following options: <b>Delete</b>, <b>Edit</b>, and <b>Hide</b> category

When I click the ellipsis (<b>...</b>) button for any created subcategory or team
Then I see the following options: <b>Delete</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Hide</b>, <b>Move</b> subcategory or team

When I click the ellipsis (<b>...</b>) button for static categories (<b>Lifestyle</b>, <b>Dealbook</b>, <b>Video</b>, <b>Team hub</b>)
Then I see an option <b>Hide</b> category

When I select a subcategory and click <b>Move</b>
Then I see a drop-down list with categories

When I select any category from the list
Then I see the subcategory with all teams inside is moved to the selected category
  And I see this subcategory at the top of the list of navigation menu subcategories for the selected category

When I select team and click <b>Move</b>
Then I see a menu with the list of categories and their subcategories where I can move the selected team

When I select any subcategory from the list
Then I see the team is moved to the selected subcategory
  And I see this team at the top of the list of the navigation menu teams for the selected subcategory in the category

When I click <b>Save</b> at the top of the page
Then I see changes applied to the category, subcategory, or team are saved
