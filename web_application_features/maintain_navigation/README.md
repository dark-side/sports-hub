## Description

A navigation menu should be visible on every page of the Sports Hub site on the left side. The navigation menu consists of the following menu items:
  - Home
  - News pages configured by admin (e.g. NFL, NBA, Golf, Soccer, etc.)
  - Lifestyle
  - Dealbook
  - Video
  - Team hub

The Home, Lifestyle, Dealbook, Video, and Team hub menu items are static categories.
Site admins can add as many sports categories as they prefer. If there are lots of the sports categories configured, then there should be a scroll bar added to the menu section.

Some of the sports categories have subcategories. Subcategories contain a list of the teams related to them. For example, the NFL sports category consists of the following subcategories: AFC East, AFC North, AFC South. The AFC South contains the following teams: Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Tennessee.

When users hover over a category in the main navigation menu that consists of the subcategories, this category is highlighted and a drop-down menu with links to the subcategories appears on the UI. When users select the subcategory, they are redirected to the subcategory news page.
When users hover over the subcategory in the secondary navigation menu that consists of the teams, this subcategory is highlighted and a drop-down menu with the list of teams appears on the UI. When users select the team, they are redirected to a team news page.

The Lifestyle, Dealbook, Video, and Team hub menu categories do not have subcategories, so when users hover over one of these categories, only this category is highlighted. When users select one of these categories, they are redirected to the appropriate category news page.
Admin user configures a list of categories, subcategories, and teams visible in the navigation menu.

The user with admin permissions should be able to manage teams, namely:
  - Add a new team
  - View existing teams
  - Edit an existing team
  - Remove an existing team
  - Filter existing teams
