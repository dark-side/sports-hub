## Description

Application users should be able to subscribe and then receive daily news emails from Sports Hub. The content of the news should depend on the subscription type. If users are subscribed to a specific sport category/subcategory/team page, the newsletter email should contain articles related to the subscribed category/subcategory/team. If users are subscribed to the Home page, they should receive an email with articles related to any of the sports categories.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Users should be able to subscribe to general news by subscribing on the Home page
