## Description

Users should be able to see advertisements at the top of the right sidebar of the site. Users should be able to click on the advertisement and then be redirected to the advertised website. The advertisement should be related to the category that is being viewed.
The admin user should be able to configure the advertisements list: add new advertisements, edit, delete, and disable advertisements for the whole site. Two types of advertisements should be supported:
  - Category related
  - Site-wide

When an admin user publishes a new advertisement, they can optionally choose the advertisement category. If no category is selected, the advertisement is site-wide and will be shown on any page of the site. If a category is selected for an ad, this ad should be displayed only on the site pages related to the selected category.
When there is more than one ad that should be shown in the category, ads will be rotating every 3 seconds.
