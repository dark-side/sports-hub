## Description

    As a site user
    I want to able be to open the category or team page
    So that I can view articles that are related to the selected category or team

## Acceptance criteria
<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A site user views the category or team page</i></b>

Given I am a site user

When I view the category or team page
Then I see:
  - Heading at the top of the page that contains the path to the page (example: NBA\AFC South\Tennessee)
  - Big photo from the most recent article in the selected category or team with the square on the right side of the photo that contains:
    1. Article headline
    2. Article metadata (including author and source)
    3. The <b>More</b> button in the lower-left corner
  - The list of articles (the number of articles to show can be specified in the CMS) located below the photo from the most recent article including:
    1. Article thumbnail photo in the left side
    2. Article headline to the right from the photo
    3. First few sentences of the article content
  - Scroll bar next to the list of articles

When I click any article or click <b>More</b>
Then I am taken to the page containing the article

When I scroll the list of the articles
Then I see the list of articles increases
  And I see the list of articles should be relevant to the selected category or team topics
  And I see the number of articles that appear in the list should be defined in the CMS
