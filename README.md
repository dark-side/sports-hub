## Software Development Practice Lab

Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

There is a time when you want to 
- learn about software development processes and what they consist of
- find a project idea when you start to learn new technology and want to practice new skills. 

Here we created the requirements of the sample product [Sports Hub portal](/sports_hub_portal/) which contains:
- product requirements for Web, Mobile, and Desktop applications
- test cases
- UI/UX
- architecture
- IaaS, CI/CD for different clouds
