## Description

To gather information from sports fans and build statistics, we need to have functionality that will allow us to create questionnaires.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Admin should be able to create, edit, delete, and close a survey
  - Admin should be able to send a survey to users
  - Admin should be able to review voting results
