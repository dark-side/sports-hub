## Description

When users are viewing pages that contain the <b>Most popular</b> and <b>Most commented</b> sections, they should be able to see articles that have the highest number of views (<b>Most popular</b>) or the highest number of comments (<b>Most commented</b>) during the period configured by admin. The <b>Most popular</b> and <b>Most commented</b> sections should be context-sensitive:
  - Home page contains the most popular and most commented articles from the whole articles list
  - Any other page contains the most popular and the most commented articles that belong to the same category, subcategory, or team as the current page

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Users should be able to see articles with the highest number of visits during the period configured by admin in the <b>Most popular</b> section
  - Users should be able to see articles with the highest number of comments during the period configured by admin in the <b>Most commented</b> section
