## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to create surveys on the portal

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user configures surveys on the portal</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I view the site
Then I see the Surveys menu item on the left sidebar menu

When I go to the <b>Surveys</b> configuration page
Then I see <b>Opened</b> and <b>Closed</b> tabs, the <b>Reader Poll</b> section, and <b>+ New Survey</b> button
  And I see the <b>Opened</b> tab contains:
    - Question
    - Status (Not published, Published)
    - Actions (for Published: Close; for Not published: Publish)
    - Responses â€“ the number of people who passed the survey
    - Delete icon for each row
  And I see unpublished surveys are at the top of the list

When I click <b>+ New Survey</b>
Then I see a new survey form on the right side that contains
  - A required text field for a question
  - A calendar icon to select a period for voting, required and cannot be selected for the past date
  - A required input field for the answer option
  - The link button to add one more answer option
  - <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons

When I enter a new question with options and click <b>Save</b>
Then I see the survey is saved to the database in the <b>Not published</b> status
  And I see a survey question appears at the top of the list on the <b>Opened</b> tab

When I select the <b>Not published</b> survey on the <b>Opened</b> tab
Then I see the survey read-only details in the <b>Reader Poll</b> on the right side
  And I see the <b>Delete</b> and <b>Edit</b> buttons

When I click <b>Edit</b>
Then I see edit form with pre-populated data, the <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons

When I change any information and click <b>Save</b>
Then I see the updated survey on the <b>Opened</b> tab

When I select the <b>Not published</b> survey and <b>Delete</b> button in the <b>Reader Poll</b>
Then I see a confirmation dialog

When I confirm deletion on the confirmation dialog
Then I see a success message
  And I see the survey is removed from the list

When I hover over the survey on the list
Then I see the delete icon

When I click the delete icon
Then I see a confirmation dialog

When I confirm deletion on the confirmation dialog
Then I see a success message
  And I see the survey is removed from the list

<i>You have two options to render a big list: use pagination or infinite scroll</i>
