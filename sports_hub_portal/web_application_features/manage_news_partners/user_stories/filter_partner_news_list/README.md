<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin is viewing the partners articles list page</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

Then I see a list of articles from the partners
  And I see filters above the articles list to:
    - filter by the category
    - filter by the subcategory
    - filter by the team
    - filter by the partner
