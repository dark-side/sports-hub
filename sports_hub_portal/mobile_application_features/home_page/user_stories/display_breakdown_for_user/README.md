    As a user
    I want to be able to see the Breakdown section on the page

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A user views the Breakdown section on the Home page</i></b>

Given I am an user

When I am on the <b>Home</b> page
Then I see a <b>Breakdown</b> section after the <b>Main articles</b> section
  And I see the section contains the heading <b>Breakdown</b>
  And I see 4 newest articles for the category are formed into a group
  And I see each article contains:
    - Photo
    - Headline
    - Caption - for 3 secondary articles

When the <b>Subcategory</b> is selected by admin
Then I see only news from this subcategory

When the <b>Team</b> is selected by admin
Then I see only news from this team

When the <b>Breakdown</b> section is hidden by admin
Then I don't see the <b>Breakdown</b> section

When the <b>Breakdown</b> section is unhidden by admin
Then I see the <b>Breakdown</b> section

When some breakdown is deleted from the <b>Breakdown</b> section
Then I don't see it anymore in the <b>Breakdown</b> section

When I select any of the article photos, headlines, or captions in the <b>Breakdown</b> section
Then I am taken to the right article page
