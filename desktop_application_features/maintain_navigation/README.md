## Description

A navigation menu should be visible on every page of the Sports Hub site on the left side. The navigation menu consists of the following menu items:
  - Home
  - News pages configured by admin (e.g. NFL, NBA, Golf, Soccer, etc.)
  - Lifestyle
  - Dealbook
  - Video
  - Team hub

The Home, Lifestyle, Dealbook, Video, and Team hub menu items are static categories.
Site admins can add as many sports categories as they prefer. If there are lots of the sports categories configured, then there should be a scroll bar added to the menu section.

Some of the sports categories have subcategories. Subcategories contain a list of the teams related to them. For example, the NFL sports category consists of the following subcategories: AFC East, AFC North, AFC South. The AFC South contains the following teams: Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Tennessee.

Admin user configures a list of categories, subcategories, and teams visible in the navigation menu.

The user with admin permissions should be able to manage teams, namely:
  - Add a new team
  - View existing teams
  - Edit an existing team
  - Remove an existing team
  - Filter existing teams
