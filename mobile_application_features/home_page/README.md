## Description

When users visit our application, they should see the main page by default. The main page is called <b>Home</b> in the Main menu. This page should contain the most recent news and topics, and consist of the following page sections:
  - <b>Main articles</b>: There should be from 1 and up to 5 articles in the section
  - <b>Breakdown</b>: The <b>Breakdown</b> section has to consist of breakdowns with 2-4 articles
  - <b>Photo of the day</b>
  - <b>Most popular</b>
  - <b>Most commented</b>

All of these sections are configured by the admin user who can enable or disable them (allow them to be shown or not).

The <b>Most popular</b> and <b>Most commented</b> functionalities are described in the separate feature.
