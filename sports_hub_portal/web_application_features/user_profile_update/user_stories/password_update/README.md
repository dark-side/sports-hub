## Description

    As a site user
    I want to be able to update my password

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A site user updates password</i></b>

Given I am a site user on the Change password tab in my profile

And I see a form with three fields:
  - Old password
  - New password
  - Password confirmation

When I enter a new password
Then I see my input as bullets
  And I see an icon that shows me the information I enter

When I enter an old, new password, confirmation password, and click <b>Change Password</b>
Then the system saves the changes and displays a message about success

When I enter the wrong old password and click <b>Change Password</b>
Then I see an error message "Password does not match"

When I enter a new password and confirmation password that do not match, and click <b>Change Password</b>
Then I see an error message "Password does not match"

When I enter a password with an invalid format
Then I see an error message "Use at least 8 characters that includes numbers and letters"
</pre>
