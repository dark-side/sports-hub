## Description

We want to allow our users to chat with each other and leave their comments on news articles and videos where it is enabled by the admin. Registered and logged-in users should have the ability to:
  - Leave their comments on articles
  - Reply to other comments
  - Edit and delete their comments
  - Like and dislike comments

Not registered and not logged-in users should have the ability to read comments. We should ask users to log in to the application when they attempt to add a comment or like.

## Check list:
