## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to configure the list of advertisements
    So that it is possible to promote them via the Sports Hub site

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin configures the list of advertisements</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I view the <b>Advertising</b> configuration page
Then I see the following:
  - Table with a list of available advertisements that contains ads name, status, and actions
  - Section with advertisements’ labels and the <b>+ New Ad</b> button in the header section

When I click <b>+ New Ad</b>
Then I see the <b>Enter new Ad name</b> dialog with the <b>Name</b> input, and the <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons

When I enter the name of a new ad and click <b>Save</b>
Then I see a new ad is added on the top of the ads table. Ad’s preview block is displayed on the right side of the page with a date of Ad’s creation and the configuration page which contains:
  - URL input for the advertised item
  - List of categories where advertisement should be displayed (Note: advertisement category is optional. If no category is selected, then advertisement can be shown on any page of the site)
  - <b>Opened</b> (the number that indicates how many times the user selected the advertised item, the default value for new advertisement is 0)
  - <b>Displayed</b> (the number that indicates how many times an advertisement is displayed on the site, the default value for the new advertisement is 0)
  - <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons

When I enter the advertisement URL
Then I see an advertisement image in the preview block on the right side of the page

When I select some category for the advertisement
Then the user sees this advertisement only on those pages that are related to a specified category

When I don't select any category
Then the user sees this advertisement on any page of the site

When I select any advertisement on the table
  And I change the status from inactive to active
Then the user sees an advertisement on the Sports Hub site

When I change the status from active to inactive
Then user does not see ads on the Sports Hub site

When I click the edit icon
Then the form with advertisement details is opened and I can edit the advertisement

When I click the delete icon
Then confirmation pop-up window appears

When I click the <b>Yes</b> button on the confirmation pop-up window
Then I see that the advertisement is deleted
</pre>
