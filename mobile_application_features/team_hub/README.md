## Description

All sports fans have their favorite team or teams. The goal of this feature is to allow registered users to customize Team hub where they will see news related only to their favorite teams. In case users do not select favorite teams, they will see news about the teams from their geolocation.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype:
  - Users should be able to customize the news
  - Users should be able to select favorite teams
  - Users should be able to read news about favorite teams
  - Users should be able to unfollow a team
  - Geolocation should work and users should be able to select related teams if the list of favorite teams is empty
