## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to configure a list of banners
    So that users can see them while viewing the Sports Hub site

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user configures a list of banners</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I view the <b>Banners</b> configuration page
Then I see the following:
  - Section with the <b>Banners</b> heading and the <b>+ New Banner</b> button under the header section
  - Search icon
  - <b>Opened</b> and <b>Closed</b> tabs with the number of banners displayed next to the tab name, and the list of banners below
  - <b>Predefined Banners</b> section with a table which contains four predefined banners: <b>Facebook Video</b>, <b>Facebook Post</b>, <b>Lifestyle</b>, <b>Dealbook</b> with the <b>Show/Hide</b> toggle for each of them

When I view the <b>Opened</b> tab
Then I see a table with a list of the opened banners that contains:
  - Banner name
  - Banner status
  - Status filter
  - Category in which this banner should be displayed

When I click <b>Status</b> drop-down list for any banner
Then I see the action options:
  - <b>Publish</b> for non published banner
  - <b>Close</b> for published banner

When I click <b>Publish</b> for non published banner
Then I see the banner status is changed to <b>Published</b>

When I change the banner category
Then I see published in is updated with that category

When I select any banner from the table
Then I see a banner preview block at the right side of the page with a banner photo

When I select a published banner
Then I see a publish date of the banner in the preview section
  And the category drop-down list is disabled

When I select an unpublished banner
Then I see the last update date of the banner and the <b>Edit</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons in the preview section
  And the category drop-down list is enabled

When I click <b>Edit</b>
Then I see the a picture section, banner name field, <b>Save</b> and <b>Delete</b> buttons

When I delete a picture or banner name and click <b>Save</b>
Then I see the error message that the banner name and picture must be present

When I click <b>+ New banner</b>
Then <b>+ New banner</b> disappears
  And I see a picture section, banner name field, <b>Save</b> and <b>Cancel</b> buttons

When I enter the banner name and click <b>Save</b>
Then I see a banner is displayed at the top of the banners table in <b>Not published</b> status and a fist category from the categories list is defaulted

When I view the <b>Closed</b> tab
Then I see a table with a list of closed banner names, close date, and category it was published in

When I select any banner from the table
Then I see a banner preview section on the right side of the page with a banner photo

When I hover over the banner in the table
Then I see the <b>Delete</b> button appears on the right of the banner row

When I click <b>Delete</b>
Then the confirmation popover appears

When I confirm deleting on the popover
Then I see the banner is deleted
