## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user views the list of existing articles in the category</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I select any sports category link on the admin side
Then I see the following:
  - The <b>+ New Article</b> button in the upper-right corner of the page
  - The preview icon
  - A drop-down list filtered by statuses (<b>All, Published, Unpublished</b>) with default value <b>All</b>
  - A drop-down list filtered by subcategories with default value <b>All subcategories</b>
  - A drop-down list filtered by teams with default value <b>All teams</b>
  - The search icon
  - The list of blocks â€“ one block per one existing article from the selected category where each block has:
    - Article thumbnail photo on the left side
    - Article headline on the right from the photo
    - First few sentences of the article
    - Category and team names below the article text
    - Status of the article (Published/Unpublished)
  - The scroll bar next to the list of articles

When I scroll the list of the articles
Then I see the list of articles is appended with a new portion of articles

Then I see available items in the team drop-down filter is refreshed
  And I see the list of articles is refreshed
  And I see only articles that are related to selected subcategory

Then I see only unpublished articles

Then I see the list of articles is refreshed with matching results
(<i>Search can start when the first symbol is entered or when at least 3 symbols are entered</i>)

Then I see how this category is shown for the users
  And I see <b>Back to admin page</b> link

When I select <b>Back to admin page</b> link
Then I am taken back to the category admin page

Then I see the ellipsis (<b>...</b>) button in the upper-right corner

When I click the "<b>...</b>" menu icon
Then I see the following options:
  - <b>Unpublish</b> if the article is published or <b>Publish</b> if the article is unpublished
