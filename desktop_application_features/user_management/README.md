## Description

We allow users to register in our application. We need a place where we can review and manage a list of users if needed. This should be available on the admin side. In the list we can review users’:
  - Profile picture
  - First and last name
  - Status: active, blocked
  - Online/offline availability
  - Role: user and admin
  - Amount of users and admins

We want to do the following actions to the user accounts:
  - <i>Delete</i> – the user should be removed from the system and not have the ability to log in to the system.
  - <i>Block</i> – the user should be blocked which means the user will not be able to comment on any article or video. Users should be notified about this action.
  - <i>Activate</i> – only blocked users can be activated. Users should be notified about this action.
  - <i>Make as admin</i> – the user will receive admin permissions. Users should be notified about this action.
  - <i>Remove from admins</i> – removes admin permission from the user. Users should be notified about this action.

## Check list:

  - Admin should be able to delete users
  - Admin should be able to block users
  - Admin should be able to activate users that were blocked
  - Admin should be able to give admin permissions to users
  - Admin should be able to remove admin permission from users
  - Users should be able to receive emails that inform them about admin’s actions
