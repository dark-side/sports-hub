## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to filter the Teams page

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user views the <b>Teams</b> page and filters the existing teams</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I view the <b>Teams</b> page
Then I see the button <b>+Add team</b> in the page header
  And I see the section with the map (with the <b>Reset, Zoom in</b>, and <b>Zoom out</b> icons) on the left side and the filter form on the right that has the following elements:
    - <b>Select location</b> drop-down list box (default value "All")
    - <b>Select category</b> drop-down list box (default value "All")
    - <b>Select subcategory</b> drop-down list box (default value "All")
    - <b>Team</b> box
    - The <b>Apply</b> button (disabled by default)
    - The <b>Cancel</b> button (disabled by default)
  And I see the section with the list of existing teams in the table consisting of:
    - Teams
    - Location
    - Added at
    - Category
    - Subcategory
  And I see all columns can be sorted by clicking the title
  And I see a search field

When I click anywhere on the map
Then I see the <b>Select location</b> drop-down list is filled in according to the selected location on the map

When I fill in filter drop-downs in the form on the right side of the map and click the <b>Apply</b> button
Then I see the teams in the list are filtered according to selected values in the drop-downs

When I click the <b>Cancel</b> button
Then I see filter drop-downs are cleared
  And I see all teams on the list

When I view the list of the teams
Then I see the pagination block in the bottom
  And I see the string with the total number of found teams
  And I see the <b>Result per page</b> field with the options: 10, 20, 45, 90

When I change the number in the <b>Result per page</b> field
Then I see the grid is refreshed according to the number

When I type a team name in the search field
Then I see the table is refreshed with the matching results
(<i>Search can start when the first symbol is entered or when at least 3 symbols are entered</i>)
