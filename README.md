## Hands-on learning with real-world tasks with Sports Hub

Your professional development journey with the Sports Hub space can help you to carve out and dedicate more time to learning and practicing software programming, data development, testing, test automation, and software configuration, freeing yourself from tasks like product ideation, platform solution design documentation, and feature requirements documentation.

To become proficient in professional software development, it's crucial to engage associates in accomplishing practical technical tasks focused on reaching a product's development goals and requirements, which are part of real-world projects professionals do regularly.

Software development involves various steps such as conceptualization, specification, design, programming, testing, documentation, release, and maintenance. This covers the creation and maintenance of applications and software components.

During professional growth on real-world projects or preparation to work on real-world projects, there is a lack of practical tasks on which associates can grow. This leads to the need to define a learning project with product requirements to practice specific technical aspects of the role that professionals do according to functional and non-functional requirements based on clearly described product features, with the use cases, mock-ups, demo flows, test cases, and architecture diagrams.

The development process of creating such types of requirements and documentation requires a large amount of time. Usually, such activities take a significant part of the time dedicated to the skill-ups of software engineers, data engineers, infrastructure engineers, or quality engineers. Sometimes the creation of such documents may take 40%-60% of the time you dedicate to learning.

We believe that during learning and professional development, activities will be extremely useful to have pre-defined requirements suitable for practicing task accomplishment. In such cases, the learning process of 80%-90% will be focused on learning activities and practical work activities that the professionals do according to their role on project assignments. It is useful when you are involved in such events as rump-up, skill-up, simulation training, executive coaching, mentorship programs, workshops, boot camps, micro learnings, etc.

This Sports Hub space is aimed at describing a product with distinct business goals and requirements to meet user and customer expectations for the development of a custom platform that covers front-end, mobile, desktop, back-end, API, and data domains for representing the sports news and events related to different types of sports. It allows you to use all the documentation to cover a huge variety of product features' requirements that can be used as development tasks during your practice over your learning journey.

The Sports Hub space documentation includes:

- Product details overview
- Product functional/non-functional requirements
- Test cases for functional requirements
- UI/UX design for functional requirements
- Detailed UI/UX design demo workflows
- Technical Architecture diagrams and specifics
- API specification documentation
- Infrastructure and cloud design
- Deployment details for cloud infrastructure
- Data design, including flows and pipelines
- Requirements for web, mobile, and desktop applications
- Product roadmap with estimation templates
- Technical task examples for Web, Mobile, and Desktop
- Technical task examples for Data and Infrastructure
- Effort estimation templates for Web, Mobile, and Desktop
- Effort estimation templates for Data and Infrastructure

For sure, when you start learning and a professional development journey, it might be difficult to define a point from which you can start working with a bunch of those documents. Therefore, we create GitHub pages and video guides from which you can start your work on familiarization with the Sports Hub portal requirements for your growth.

The information provided in the documentation is sufficient to undertake various technical tasks, allowing you to enhance your skills across development processes within a chosen role, technological stack, or domain. This enables you to dedicate more time to actual programming than to preparing task specifications.

We hope that the space will be useful for software engineers (front-end, back-end, full-stack, API, mobile, and desktop directions), data engineers (databases and data visualization directions), infrastructure engineers (DevOps and Clouds directions), and quality engineers (quality control and test automation directions).

## Problem definition

These days, in a world filled with different kinds of news presented on various websites, itâ€™s rather hard and time-consuming to find the information we need. When it comes to sports, fans spend a fair amount of time browsing the web in order to find hot news relevant to their best-loved kind of sports or their favorite league or team.
