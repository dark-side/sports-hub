    As an admin user

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user logs in to the portal</i></b>

Given I have an account on the Sports Hub site (seeded to the datatabase)

When I visit any page on the site
Then I see the <b>Log in</b> button in the upper-right corner of the page

When I click <b>Log in</b>
Then I am taken to the <b>Log in</b> page

When I enter all the fields with the seeded admin data and click <b>Log in</b>
