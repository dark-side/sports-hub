## Description

Create an application project layout structure that will be common for any of the pages:
- Header section
- Footer section
- Main menu expandable section on the left up side
- Profile menu on the right up side

Also, there should be a special behavior of the logo. It should navigate users to the Home page.

## Check list:

  - Verify if UI corresponds to the prototype
  - Users should go to the Home page by tapping the logo
  - The layout structure should be the same for all pages
  - Pages should be built from content sections that are configured by admin
