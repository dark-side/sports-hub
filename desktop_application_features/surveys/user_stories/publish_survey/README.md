## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to be able to publish surveys
    So that users can see them and vote

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user publishes the survey</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I am on the <b>Surveys</b> page and view the <b>Opened</b> tab
Then I see a <b>Publish</b> action for <b>Not published</b> surveys

When I click <b>Publish</b>
Then I see a success message
  And I see the survey status is changed to <b>Published</b>
  And the survey is visible for site users

When I select a <b>Published</b> survey
Then I see a survey read-only details in the <b>Reader Poll</b> without any action buttons
  And I see the progress bars for each answer
</pre>
