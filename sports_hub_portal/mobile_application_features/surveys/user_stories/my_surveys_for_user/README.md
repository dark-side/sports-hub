## Description

    As a user
    I want to see a list of all surveys
    So that I can vote

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A user visits My surveys page</i></b>

Given I am logged in as a user

When I view any page of the application
  And I tap the my profile picture at the top of the page
Then I see the <b>My surveys</b> menu item

When I tap <b>My surveys</b>
Then I see the <b>My surveys</b> page is opened
  And I see the system displays only surveys published by admin
  And I see the system displays two tabs: <b>Opened</b> and <b>Closed</b>
  And I see the <b>Opened</b> tab is active by default

When I tap <b>Opened</b>
Then I see the <b>Opened</b> list contains active surveys and is sorted by creation date
  And I see each survey can be expanded by the Expand icon
  And I see each survey has Due date
  And I see <b>Sort by</b> dropdown with Newest (default), Most Popular and About to Expire options

When I tap <b>Closed</b>
Then I see the <b>Closed</b> list contains closed surveys and is sorted by close date
  And I see each survey can be expanded by the Expand icon
  And I see each survey has Close date
  And I see the filter there with All surveys, Voted options (NOTE: <i>Voted</i> surveys are surveys user participated in)
