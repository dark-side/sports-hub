## Description

    As an admin user
    I want to edit existing unpublished videos

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: An admin user edits the existing unpublished video</i></b>

Given I am logged in as an admin user

When I select the <b>Video</b> link on the admin side
Then I see the list of blocks with videos

When I hover over an unpublished video
Then I see the ellipsis (...) button in the upper-right corner

When I click "..." the menu icon for unpublished video
Then I see the <b>Edit</b> menu item is present

When I select <b>Edit</b> menu item
Then I see a pre-populated form with video details:
  - Play and pause the video, enter a full-screen video mode, configure video volume and video settings
  - <b>Video</b> title field
  - The <b>Preview</b> icon in the upper-right corner of the page
  - The <b>Comments Show/Hide</b> toggle
  - <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons in the upper-right corner of the page (<b>Save</b> disabled until any changes are made)

When I select the <b>Preview</b> link button
Then I see how this video is shown for users

When I make any changes in the form
Then I see the <b>Save</b> button is enabled

When I click the <b>Save</b> button
Then I see the page with a list of the videos
  And I see that my updated video appears at the top of the list in <b>Unpublished</b> state

When I click <b>Cancel</b>
Then I see the confirmation dialog, where I should confirm that I want to leave the form without saving changes

When I click <b>Confirm</b>
Then I see the page with a list of the videos
  And changes to the video are not saved
</pre>
