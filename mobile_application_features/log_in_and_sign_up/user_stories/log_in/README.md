Then I see the <b>Log in</b> button in the upper-right corner of the page

When I tap <b>Log in</b>
Then I am taken to the <b>Log in</b> page
  And I see the page with the fields: <b>Email</b>, <b>Password</b>, and the <b>Log in</b> button
  And I see <b>Google</b> and <b>Facebook</b> icons above the fields
  And I see the link "Forgot password?" above the <b>Password</b> field
  And I see the <b>Get Started</b> link in the upper-right corner of the page, next to the label "Donâ€™t have an account?"

When I fill in all the fields on the <b>Log in</b> page and tap <b>Log in</b>
Then I am authenticated in the application

Then I see my name
  And I see next items in the drop-down profile menu:
    - Personal
    - Change password
