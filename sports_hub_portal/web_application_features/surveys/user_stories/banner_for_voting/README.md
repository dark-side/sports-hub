## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A site user sees a survey banner on news pages</i></b>

Given I am a site user

When I am on any site page
Then I see the banner with the form of the newest <b>Reader Poll</b> that contains:
  - Survey active period
  - Question
  - Answer options
  - Active <b>Next</b> question button
  - Disabled <b>See the results</b> button

When I am logged in and click <b>Next</b>
Then I see the next survey

When I am logged in and choose an answer
Then I see the <b>See the results</b> button is active

When I am logged in and click the <b>See the results</b> button
Then I see the progress bar for each answer option
  And I see the <b>Back to survey</b> button

When I am logged in and click the <b>Back to survey</b> button
Then I see the next survey question
  And the previously voted survey is moved to the <b>Closed</b> tab

When I am not logged in and click <b>Next</b> or try to choose an answer
Then I see the pop-up window "Please log in to vote" with the log-in form
