## Description

    As a logged-in user
    I want to go to the Team hub page
    So that I can read news about my favorite teams

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A logged-in user visits the Team hub page</i></b>

Given I am logged in as a site user

When I am on any page of the application
Then I see <b>Team hub</b> on the navigation menu

When I click <b>Team hub</b>
Then I see the list of news that is sorted according to the teams I selected in my personal cabinet
  And I see the <b>Most popular</b> and <b>Most commented</b> sections

When I click <b>Unfollow</b> any team
Then I see the confirmation pop-up window

When I confirm the action
Then I see the team news disappears from the page
And I see the message "You have unfollowed the team {team name}!"
