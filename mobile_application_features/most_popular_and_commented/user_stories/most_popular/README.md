## Description

    As a user
    I want to view the Most popular section 
    So that I can read articles that have the highest number of views during the period configured by admin (day, week, month, year)

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A user views the Most popular section</i></b>

Given I am a user

When I view a page with the <b>Most popular</b> section
Then I see this section has a list with 3 most popular articles (most popular based on page views in the configured period)
  And I see that each article has:
    - Thumbnail photo
    - Headline (on the right from the photo)
    - Caption (under Headline)

When I select an article
Then I am taken to the article page
  And the <b>Most popular</b> section is context-sensitive which means:
    - Home page contains the most popular articles from the whole articles list
    - Any other page contains the most popular articles that belong to a category, subcategory, or team of the current page

When the <b>Most popular</b> section is hidden by admin
Then I don’t see the <b>Most popular</b> section on any page where it can be present

When the <b>Most popular</b> section is unhidden by admin
Then I see the <b>Most popular</b> section on any page where it can be present
</pre>
