## Description

    As a user
    I want to sort comments and like or dislike the comment

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A user sorts comments and likes or dislikes comments</i></b>

Given I am logged in as a user

When I view an article page
Then I see the number of existing comments, a list of existing comments with 2 most recent comments at the top, and the <b>Show more</b> button at the bottom
  And I see a drop-down list with options to sort by most popular, oldest first, or newest first

When I select an option from the drop-down list
Then I see a comments list is updated based on my selection

When I tap <b>Show more</b>
Then I see more comments are loaded (up to 5)

When more comments are loaded
Then <b>Show less</b> button appears

When I view an existing comment
Then I see <b>Like</b> and <b>Dislike</b> with numbers

When I tap <b>Like</b> or <b>Dislike</b>
Then I see a corresponding number increases

When I tap <b>Like</b> or <b>Dislike</b> for already liked or disliked comment
Then I see a corresponding number decreases

When I am logged out and tap <b>Like</b> or <b>Dislike</b>
Then I see the message "Please log in to like or dislike comments" with the link to the log-in page

<i>NOTE: Comments section should also work in the same way for videos.</i>
