## Description

    As a site user
    I want to be able to log in with an email and password

## Acceptance criteria

<pre>
<b><i>Scenario: A site user logs in to the portal</i></b>

Given I have an account on the Sports Hub site

When I visit any page on the site
Then I see the <b>Log in</b> button in the upper-right corner of the page

When I click <b>Log in</b>
Then I am taken to the <b>Log in</b> page
  And I see the page with the fields: <b>Email</b>, <b>Password</b>, and the <b>Log in</b> button
  And I see <b>Google+</b> and <b>Facebook</b> icons above the fields
  And I see the link "Forgot password?" above the <b>Password</b> field
  And I see the <b>Get Started</b> button in the upper-right corner of the page, next to the label "Donâ€™t have an account?"

When I entered all the fields on the <b>Log in</b> page and click <b>Log in</b>
Then I am authenticated at the website
  And I am taken to the home page
  And the log in link is replaced with my name
  And I see the <b>Log out</b> button in the drop-down menu next to my name
  And I see the <b>View profile</b> item in the drop-down menu next to my name

When I click <b>View profile</b>
Then I am taken to my profile page
  And I see 4 tabs:
    - Personal
    - Change password
    - My surveys
    - Team hub
  And the <b>Personal</b> tab is active and contains my information:
    - My profile picture
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Email
